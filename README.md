# Bike Sales Analysis - India

## Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of motorcycle sales in India to uncover insights into pricing patterns, brand market share, and resale value predictions. The analysis includes comprehensive data preparation, exploratory data analysis with visualizations, outlier detection, and a predictive model for estimating bike resale values.

## Features
- Data cleaning and missing value handling
- Feature engineering to derive valuable insights
- 14 different visualizations exploring various aspects of the data
- Outlier detection using IQR method
- Linear regression model to predict bike resale prices
- Interactive prediction functionality

## Dataset
The dataset (`bike_sales_india.csv`) contains information about motorcycle sales in India, including:
- Brand and model information
- Price and resale price
- Engine capacity and mileage
- Year of manufacture and registration
- Location data (state and city tier)
- Usage patterns (average daily distance)
- Insurance and ownership status

## Requirements
```
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
```

## Data Preparation
The code handles missing values in columns like average daily distance, brand, model, and fuel type by replacing them with means or modes as appropriate. It also creates several derived features:

- Bike Age: Calculated from year of manufacture
- Is_New: Binary flag for newly manufactured bikes
- Is_Insurance_Expired: Binary flag based on insurance status
- Price_per_CC: Cost per engine capacity unit
- Resale_Ratio: How much value the bike retains
- Avg_KM_per_Year: Average annual distance traveled

## Exploratory Data Analysis

**Objective**: To track how bike registrations (sales) have changed over time, revealing demand trends or dips across years.

### 10. Bike Price Distribution by City Tier
Box plot comparing prices across different city tiers.

![Bike Price Distribution by City Tier](./Chart_10.png)

**Objective**: To compare bike price ranges in different tiers of cities, reflecting how location influences pricing.

### 11. Price vs Resale Price Correlation
Scatter plot examining relationship between original and resale prices.

![Price vs Resale Price](./Chart_11.png)

**Objective**: To explore the relationship between original price and resale price, identifying patterns in value retention across price segments.

### 12. Fuel Type Trends Over Years
Grouped bar plot showing fuel type popularity changes.

![Fuel Type Trends](./Chart_12.png)

**Objective**: To track how the usage of different fuel types in bikes has changed over the years, revealing shifts toward or away from certain fuel types (e.g., electric).

### 13. Pairplot of Numeric Features
Multi-dimensional analysis of selected numeric variables.

![Pairplot of Features](.Chart_13.png)

**Objective**: To analyze relationships and distributions among selected numeric features, while observing how they vary across years of manufacture.

### 14. Average Price by Brand
Horizontal bar chart comparing brand pricing strategies.

![Average Price by Brand](./Chart_14.png)

**Objective**: To compare the average bike price among brands, providing insight into brand positioning (budget vs premium).

## Outlier Detection
The analysis identifies outliers in numeric columns using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method, which helps ensure model robustness.

## Predictive Modeling
A linear regression model predicts bike resale prices based on the original price:

1. Data normalization using MinMaxScaler
2. Train-test split (95%-5%)
3. Model training and evaluation using Mean Squared Error
4. User-friendly prediction function for estimating resale values

## How to Use
1. Install required libraries: `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`
2. Update the file path in the code to match your dataset location
3. Run the script to generate visualizations and the predictive model
4. Use the interactive function to predict resale values for specific bike prices

## Future Improvements
- Implement multivariate regression to incorporate more factors in resale predictions
- Explore non-linear models for potentially better prediction accuracy
- Add cross-validation for more robust model evaluation
- Develop a web interface for interactive predictions
